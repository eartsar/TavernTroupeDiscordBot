DISCLAIMER_MESSAGE = '''\
‚ÑπÔ∏è BEFORE YOU USE THIS FEATURE, YOU MUST READ THE FOLLOWING DISCLAIMER ‚ÑπÔ∏è

```Hi trouper. I'm not a lawyer or anything, but I need to be *really clear* 
about a few things before you do this. Also, sorry for constantly popping
this up - I do it whenever the underlying code has changed. So if you're
seeing this - it's because I'm a new, shinier version of myself!

1 - You are uploading a file to a personal server. Don't do this unless 
    you're comfortable with that. This should be obvious, I said it.

2 - While I SHOULD have working functionality to remove photos, I can't
    PROMISE the capability in perpetuity.

3 - You're giving consent for other people in this Discord server - or any
    other Discord server I might be installed on - to potentially view these
    photos through the current implemented features that I support.

4 - I will do my best to be respectful with your data.

4 - You will NOT give me anything even REMOTELY inappropriate. Failure to
    adhere to this can result in me being turned off, or worse.

5 - By clicking the üÜó emoji below, you understand the risks you're taking
    in using this feature. You recognize that anything that happens after
    submitting data to me is out of your hands. You also recognize that
    I've given my word, and if I fail to uphold my end of the bargain,
    you're within your right to be pissed off and seek revenge.

If you think this disclaimer missed anything that should be made clear, or
if you have any questions or comments about what I do with your data, please
do not hesitate to reach out to Discord user eartsar#3210 - my creator.```'''
